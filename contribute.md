Everyone is welcome to contribute with patches, bug-fixes and new features.

## Ideas

If you have a idéa the easiest way is to create a issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/wp-papi/papi/issues).

## Bugs

Before you submit a bug issue you should be able to run the tests that the project has. Then you know if the tests works or not.

When you submit a bug issue you should write which browser you are using since Papi contains front-end code and not only back-end code.

If a test fails you should tell which one so it's easier to know what the bug is about.

Try to be as detailed as possible in your bug issue so we can help you better with the issue.

**Please** write how to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are are allways welcome. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request.
